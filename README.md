This is a working prototype for a small scale Internet Radio which uses Multicast. 

Users can listen to the live radio feed on the stations they desire. We use the Any Source Multicast (ASM) model.

Other functionalities include :

SERVER SIDE: Can modify the radio feed, add/delete songs as well as stations.
CLIENT SIDE: Pause, play  which is synced with the live radio feed.
